We decompiled bonus3 binary to understand how it works.
The main function takes two arguments(ac and argv).

First, the program open and read from the file /home/user/end/.pass.
Then it calls atoi(argv[1]) and stores the result in a variable (iVar2).
This value is used as an index to insert a \0 into the password buffer

After that, the program compares the password to our input with strcmp.
If the two strings match, it executes: `execl("/bin/sh","sh",0)`

If we pass an empty string as our first argument:
	-> atoi("") returns 0
	-> In the password the character at index 0 will be replaced by a \0
	-> Now strcmp("", "") returns 0
