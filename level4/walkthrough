We started by decompiling the level4 program to understand how it works.
It looks very similar to level3, but there is one important difference : the number of character we need to print.

The goal is still to make a global variable called m have a specific value, so the program will execute `system("/bin/cat /home/user/level5/.pass")` and give us the password to access the level5.

But in this level, the condition checks if m is equal to a very large value : 0x1025544 (16930116)

We have a fgets to enter user input, and a printf that prints our input. 
So again, we can use the %n format specifier to write a value into m.

fgets limits the input to 520 characters, and printing 16930116 characters would go way beyond that.

To solve this, we can use format string padding. 
Instead of printing millions of characters manually, we use %<number>x to tell printf to pretend it printed that many characters.

The final command is:
`(python -c 'print "\x10\x98\x04\x08" + "%16930112x" + "%12$n"'; cat) | ./level4`
